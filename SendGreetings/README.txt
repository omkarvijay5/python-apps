This is a small python script which sends greetings for occassions to list of people through email.

This app got initiated as my father wants to send new year greetings to a bunch of relatives and he was worried about having a big list. Then i told him that dont worry i will write a script which will automate everything :)

I told him to give me just an email template which he wants to send it to everyone and then a csv file which contains list of contacts with contact name and email.

Then i thought of making this app more generic so that when he wants to send email for every occassion he just need to change the email template :)
